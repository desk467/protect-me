## The game
protect me it is a simple game in which you need to control a spaceship and protect the planet from a collision with meteors. It was design for mobile devices. But, due it was developed using LÖVE, you can run on virtually any platform, just do the packaging of the code with the correct runtime.

## The code
This project is developed with the LÖVE framework and you can view more information about this *awesome* framework through [this link](http://www.love2d.org).

I also used the set of HUMP libraries, designed by [vrld](https://github.com/vrld). You can learn more about these libraries through [this link](http://hump.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
